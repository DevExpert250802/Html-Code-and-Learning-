Div tag 
generic tag
container/wapping tag


The <div> tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document.

The <div> tag is used as a container for HTML elements - which is then styled with CSS or manipulated with JavaScript.

The <div> tag is easily styled by using the class or id attribute.

Any sort of content can be put inside the <div> tag! 

Note: By default, browsers always place a line break before and after the <div> element.



Block-level Elements
A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.

A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

Two commonly used block elements are: <p> and <div>.

The <p> element defines a paragraph in an HTML document.

The <div> element defines a division or a section in an HTML document.


Inline element
An inline element does not start on a new line.

An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.

This is a <span> element inside a paragraph.
